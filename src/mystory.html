                <p class="milestone-description">I started my study in the summer of 2016, commencing a Bachelor of Medical Science degree with the hopes of pursuing a career in Medicine. However, after some consideration, I realised that that path wasn't meant for me. As such, I transferred to a Bachelor of Science, and began slowly working towards its completion. After a few slow years, I graduated December 2022.</p>

                <p class="milestone-description">Parallel to my studies, I worked in a local pub - The White Cockatoo Hotel. This helped to break up my time and provide much needed novelty and diversity. While my time at uni taught me diligence, discipline and wider skills through academia, The White Cockatoo instilled in me a keen ability to communicate, to cooperate and manage not only my time and work, but the expectations of my patrons as well.</p>

                <p class="milestone-description">While my graduation took place in December 2022, I had actually finished my classes in June 2022, freeing up my time and providing an opportunity to diversify my skill set. In July 2022, I decided to try my hand at recruitment at Gorilla Jobs. There, I recruited Lawyers for firms in Victoria and Queensland, and gained an understanding of human resources: talent identification, acquisition and retention.
